# n-queens-mpi
Backtracking algorithms are used to methodically and exhaustively search a solution space for an optimal solution to a given problem. A classic example of a backtracking algorithm is illustrated by finding all solutions to the problem of placing N-queens on an N Ã— N chess board such that no two queens attack each other.  This repository contains source code of my B.Sc. final project which I used MPI to implement the n-qeens problem more efficiently.
